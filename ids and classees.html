    <!-- IDS AND CLASSES  -->

    <!-- IDS are used to identify the code snippet in which we have to do something with that using js and css -->
    <!-- ids's are unique,that mean any two id's don't have same name. -->
    <!-- suppose there is div tag in which some code written in it,we want to add extra features to that using the js or Css ,so we can get the div tag block of  -->
    <!-- using it's id and can manipulate the code.This is how id's are useful. -->
    <!-- id's can be in any tag like paragraph ,div,label etc -->

    <!-- CLASSES  -->
    <!-- CLASSES are similar to calsses in OOP,classes are used in CSS, there are user defined functuions in classes which are applied on the ttags which has particular classes ,classes are not unique,one tag can have many classes,like objects in OOP as a classs has many objects -->

    <div id="menubox2",class="sai"></div>
    <div id="mm3",class="sai sri angajala"></div>
    <!-- In above example menubox2 and mm3 are id's ,using which respective div tags are fetched. -->
    <!-- In 1st div tag 'sai' is the class name,it has one class that is 'sai' -->
    <!-- In 2nd div tag there are 3 classes namely 'sai','sri''angajala',classes are seperatred by spaces -->

      <!-- SHORTCUTS  -->

      <!-- WE CAN CREATE div tag with classes 'sai','sri','angajala' by notation " div.sai.sri.angajala " here div is tag sai,sri,and angajala are classes,when we write the notation and press enter then a div tag with classes sai sri angajala will create  -->
      <div class="sai sri angajala"></div>

      <!-- We can create a tag with id using the notation tag#id ,example : "div#sai" will create a div tag with id sai -->
      <!-- NOTE: the tag can be optional it may be div,paragraph,label,span etc -->
      <!-- by default the tag is div,it can be created by notation .sai.sri.angajala,it automatically takes div tag and creates a div tag with 3 classes   -->

      <!-- div#sai  -->
       <div id="sai"></div>
       <span id="sri"></span>
       <p id="angajala">
       </p>

       <!-- we can create multiple tags with specified class using notation  -->
       <!-- div.sai*4 creates div tag with class sai 4 times -->
       <div class="sai"></div>
       <div class="sai"></div>
       <div class="sai"></div>
       <div class="sai"></div>

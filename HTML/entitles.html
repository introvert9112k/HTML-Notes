        <!-- whenever we run this we see that ther is no space in paragraph 2 ,html automatically removes whatever the space we provide ,then how to get the space we used html entitles like nbsp (non breakable space ) -->
        <p>this is &nbsp;paragraph3</p>
        <!-- we can see that by using entitle nbsp we can create space between is and paragraph,if we require more space betweeen word swe can use more nbsp  -->

        <!-- suppose if we want to incldude <p> in our text,we cannot include because HTML recognizes it as tag automatically,we can include the reserved tags in html using entitles too.  -->
        <p>this is paragraph tag &lt;p &gt;   </p>
        <!-- &lt; represents '<' and &gt; represents '>' so we can write <p>  as &lt;p&gt;  -->

        
    <!-- Similarly there are many special entitles to represent the symbols in HTMl. YOU can find them in  goolge -->
